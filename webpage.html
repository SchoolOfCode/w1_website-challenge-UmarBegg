    <h2 class="title"> Hobbies </h2>
    <p class="text"> I'm a very cool person ðŸ˜Ž and (as any respectable cool person should do)
      I have a bunch of hobbies. I like walking (I've attached a picture of one of my favourite walks below),
      interior design, and reading (mostly self-exploration books by people like Joey Dispenza).
    My favourite Joey Dispenza quote is
    <strong id="jd-quote">
      <q>The body doesnâ€™t know the difference between an experience and a thought.
      You can literally change your biology, neuro-circuitry, chemicals, hormones and genes, simply by having an inner experience.</q>

    <h2 class ="title">Houses!</h2>
    <p class="text">
    Ok, so I mentioned in my hobbies secion that I like interior design. It's actually one of my life goals to build my own house.
    <a href="image.html">This</a> is probably what I'd like it to look like.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I also like to check RightMove each day on my saved search criteria to see what new houses are for sale and their interiors..

    <h2 class ="title">Coding</h2>
