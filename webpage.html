    <h2 class="title"> Hobbies </h2>
    <p class="text"> I'm a very cool person 😎 and (as any respectable cool person should do)
      I have a bunch of hobbies. I like walking (I've attached a picture of one of my favourite walks below),
      interior design, and reading (mostly self-exploration books by people like Joey Dispenza).
    My favourite Joey Dispenza quote is
    <strong id="jd-quote">
      <q>The body doesn’t know the difference between an experience and a thought.
      You can literally change your biology, neuro-circuitry, chemicals, hormones and genes, simply by having an inner experience.</q>
