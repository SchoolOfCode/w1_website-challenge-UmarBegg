# Challenge Reflection.

Okay so I am starting to realise that I should probably have been doing this reflection as I was going along, as I've now forgotten the reasoning behind some of my decisions. With that disclaimer, I'll still attempt to reflect on the process as best as I can.

## Initial thoughts and plans

When approaching this project, I knew what I had in mind. I wanted to create a nice and clean looking (modern?) website. From speaking to my partner, Rachel, she told me that she likes lighter colours, but left the colour scheme down to me. In terms of what she wanted the purpose of the page to be, she said that it should just be a general introductory page to herself, talking about some of her interests and hobbies, and getting the site visitors to get to know her more as a person.

## Execution

The first thing that I did in preparation of creating the website was to use the marksheet.io link we were given in the week 1 repo to work through the first few sections. Whilst I did find the marksheet useful for learning the basics of HTML and CSS, I found that as I started creating the page, I was wanting to do a lot of things that weren't specified in the marksheet, so I found myself constantly turning towards google for help (mainly W3schools).

One of the mistakes I made is that I would follow a pattern of "add some content -> style -> add some content -> style some more". I found this to be an inefficient method as compared with some of the others in my group who added all of their content onto html before even thinking about styling. This is because when you begin styling before you add the content, you find that the content can become very awkward to add in certain situations, and I found myself having to squeeze things in where they could have been done more naturally otherwise.

After our session on branching on git, I began following the work pattern of branch, work, commit, merge, repeat. Whilst this was a little fiddly at first, its a very easy pattern to get the rythm of, and I found this becoming second nature very quickly.

One area that I could have improved on when writing this website is to pair-programme a little more, as I feel that is still one aspect that I need to improve.

Overall, I am generally happy with my webpage. In the future I would love to add in a navigation bar and play around with the colourshcemes more.
